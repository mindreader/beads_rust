/// Exit quietly instead of aborting when stdout disappears mid-write.
///
/// `bd list | head` is the most ordinary thing a user or an agent does, and
/// before this guard it crashed the process every single time.
///
/// The chain: the Rust runtime sets `SIGPIPE` to `SIG_IGN` before `main`, so a
/// write to a pipe whose reader has exited returns `EPIPE` rather than killing
/// the process. `println!` treats a failed stdout write as unrecoverable and
/// panics ("failed printing to stdout"). Under `[profile.release]`'s
/// `panic = "abort"` that panic becomes `abort()`, so the process dies on
/// `SIGABRT` and the kernel writes a multi-megabyte core.
///
/// It was invisible in normal use, which is why it survived: a pipeline
/// reports the *last* command's exit status, so the shell said `0` while the
/// process was dying. Over 100 such cores (~288 MB) had piled up on one
/// machine before anyone noticed, and nothing on the terminal ever said a
/// word.
///
/// # Why a panic hook rather than restoring `SIG_DFL`
///
/// The conventional fix is `signal(SIGPIPE, SIG_DFL)`, but this crate sets
/// `unsafe_code = "forbid"` (and `src/lib.rs` repeats `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`)
/// — a deliberate invariant, and `forbid` cannot be locally overridden. Doing
/// it safely would mean taking on a new dependency purely to hide one `unsafe`
/// call, which is a poor trade right before a release. A panic hook needs
/// neither: it runs *before* the abort under `panic = "abort"`, so exiting
/// from it pre-empts the core dump entirely, and it covers every one of the
/// ~355 `println!` sites in the tree at once rather than only the ones someone
/// remembered to convert.
///
/// # Why exit 0
///
/// The reader closing early is the reader's own choice (`head` does it by
/// design), so the caller already knows the output was truncated — nothing is
/// being hidden from them. Dying by `SIGPIPE` would instead surface as `141`
/// under `set -o pipefail`, turning a completely normal idiom into a spurious
/// failure for every agent that pipes `bd` into `head` or `jq`. If a future
/// maintainer prefers strict unix convention, changing the `0` below to `141`
/// is the whole edit.
///
/// # Interaction with auto-flush
///
/// Exiting at a write means a mutating command can stop before its post-command
/// JSONL auto-flush runs. That is safe and self-healing: `auto_flush` gates on
/// `get_dirty_issue_count()` and dirty flags are cleared only after a
/// successful export, so the next mutating command re-exports the pending
/// rows. The mutation itself was committed to SQLite before any output was
/// printed. Nor is it a new exposure — the previous behaviour (`abort()`)
/// skipped the flush just as abruptly, only with a core dump attached.
///
/// # The failure banner, and why the order inside this hook matters
///
/// This hook also covers the one nonzero exit path that is not a
/// `std::process::exit` call: a fatal panic. The broken-pipe check must stay
/// **first**. `br list | head -1` is the most common pipeline in this fleet and
/// it arrives here as a panic; if the banner were emitted for "a panic
/// happened" rather than for the status being exited with, that entirely normal
/// command would start printing `br: FAILED (PANIC, ...)`.
///
/// The rule that keeps this correct is in `beads_rust::exit`: the banner is a
/// function of the exit status. The broken-pipe branch exits **0** and so is
/// silent, by the same rule that makes every other zero exit silent — not by a
/// special case anyone has to remember.
