//! Error types and handling for `beads_rust`.
//!
//! This module provides structured errors that match the classic bd
//! behavior for JSON error output compatibility.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! - Uses `thiserror` for derive-based error types
//! - Supports `anyhow` integration for gradual migration
//! - Provides recovery hints for user-facing errors
//! - Matches bd's exit code conventions
//! - Provides structured JSON output for AI coding agents
