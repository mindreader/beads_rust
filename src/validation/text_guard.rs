//! Guard against accidental destruction of wholesale-settable free-text fields.
//!
//! `br update --notes/--description/--design/--acceptance-criteria/--title`
//! all have REPLACE semantics: the value supplied on the command line becomes
//! the whole field. That is the right semantics — `br comments` is the
//! append-only channel — but it means a caller who *intended* to append
//! silently annihilates whatever was there, and the success line looks exactly
//! the same either way.
//!
//! This module supplies the two primitives that fix that:
//!
//! 1. [`TextChange::is_destructive_shrink`] — the TRANSITION test the update
//!    command refuses on. Gating on the transition rather than on the value is
//!    deliberate: it fires only on callers actively removing content and costs
//!    every ordinary write nothing.
//!
//!    | transition                  | verdict                        |
//!    |-----------------------------|--------------------------------|
//!    | non-empty -> empty          | refuse without the opt-in      |
//!    | non-empty -> strictly smaller | refuse without the opt-in    |
//!    | empty -> empty              | allow (no-op)                  |
//!    | anything -> same-or-larger  | allow                          |
//!
//! 2. [`TextChange::prior_retained`] — a containment test used purely for
//!    REPORTING. The shrink test is a cheap PROXY for destruction, not a
//!    detector of it: a read-modify-write whose preimage capture failed writes
//!    a *larger* value that still dropped everything that was there. That case
//!    grows and is therefore allowed; the containment flag makes it visible on
//!    the success line at the moment it happens.
//!
//!    Containment is deliberately NOT a refusal: `--notes` exists for curated
//!    current state, and legitimately rewording that state produces a value
//!    that does not contain the old one. It is high-signal as reporting and
//!    unusable as a gate.
//!
//! 3. [`TextChange::landed_as_sent`] — after the write, whether what is now
//!    stored is what bd was asked to store. Found by mutation-testing the
//!    write path: with a write that truncated its input, a 5-char field
//!    handed 16 chars reported `5 -> 5 chars, prior content retained` and
//!    exited 0. Every word of that was true and the caller's new content was
//!    gone. bd holds both the requested value and the stored result, so this
//!    comparison is free; it is reporting only, because the write has already
//!    happened by the time it can be made.
