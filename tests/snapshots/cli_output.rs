/// `br list` on a workspace with no issues.
///
/// This snapshot recorded ZERO BYTES. That expectation cannot fail: it is
/// equally satisfied by `br list` working correctly, by `br list` dying
/// before it printed anything, by its output going to stderr, and by the
/// subcommand being deleted — every one of those exits 0 and prints nothing
/// to stdout. It sat in the suite looking like a test of `br list`.
///
/// The silence itself is correct and is NOT a bug: `src/cli/commands/list.rs`
/// keeps stdout empty here deliberately, to match the Go `bd` reference
/// implementation (there are four conformance suites riding on that), and
/// `br list | wc -l` scripts depend on it. So the fix is to state the
/// expectation in a form that can fail, not to make the command speak.
///
/// The composed value pins all three facts — exit status, stdout, stderr —
/// each labelled. `stdout: <empty>` is now an assertion. The stderr block
/// pins that the command actually did its work (path validation, auto-import
/// of zero records, blocked-cache rebuild) rather than exiting early, which
/// is what makes "printed nothing" distinguishable from "did nothing".
