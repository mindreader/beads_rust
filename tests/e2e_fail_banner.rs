//! E2E tests for the nonzero-exit failure banner.
//!
//! # What is being defended
//!
//! `br`'s stream routing was already correct: a failing command writes zero
//! bytes to stdout, the whole error envelope to stderr, and exits nonzero.
//! Piping alone hid nothing. The failure needed **both** `2>&1` (merging the
//! error into the pipe) **and** a truncating filter:
//!
//! ```text
//! $ br create "" --prefix ct --json 2>&1 | tail -3
//!     }
//!   }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Every discriminating token — the `"error"` key, the code, the message — is
//! at the *top* of the envelope, and `tail` shows the *bottom*. What survives
//! is closing braces, which is also how a *success* envelope ends. Three agents
//! read those braces as success; one filed a P1 bug that did not exist.
//!
//! So these tests are about **position**, not about presence. A banner emitted
//! first is the first thing cut off, and a test that only greps stderr for the
//! banner would pass just as happily with the useless version. Every assertion
//! below that matters therefore goes through a real shell pipeline ending in
//! `tail -1`.
//!
//! # What is explicitly NOT defended: the exit code
//!
//! `$?` after a pipeline is the *last* command's status by shell semantics, so
//! `br ... | tail` reports `tail`'s 0 no matter what `br` does. Nothing here
//! can change that; only `set -o pipefail`, `${PIPESTATUS[0]}`, or not piping
//! recovers it. These tests harden the **text** channel, and they measure `br`'s
//! own status with *redirection* rather than a pipe for exactly that reason.
